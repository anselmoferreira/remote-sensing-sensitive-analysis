This folder contains the code just to show what are the Keras configurations for training each model. You may adapt this code to your own needs.

You can find the models weights and definitions already saved in the remote-sensing-sensitive-analysis/models folder.

Further details about the networks configurations and the proposed approach can be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8726132
