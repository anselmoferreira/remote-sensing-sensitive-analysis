There are two folders in this directory with a list of images. In our approach we used the lists in this directory separately, depending on what we want to do with them.

no_augmented: contains the original data. It is used to train and test the submodel #3. 
yes_augmented: augmented data using an approach we call smart batches. We used them only for training and validation of the submodels #1 and #2

Images on this list can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.21227/H2WD42
Further details about this work and smart batches approach can be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8726132
